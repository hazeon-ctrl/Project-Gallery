     <h2>Towers of Hanoi</h2>
 </li></ul>
     <p>A classic puzzle game: move the tower of discs to another location without placing larger discs
        on top of smaller ones. Base code by Ali Spittel. Attempted to add my own CSS (which is a fine mess).
        Added a nice clicking sound to disc interaction and a pretty cool BGM downloaded from
         <a href="https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/search/sfx/">Pixabay</a>.

        <ul><li><h2>Image Mirror Reversal Tool</h2></li></ul>
        <p>Quickly save a mirrored impression of any picture file, good for reversing cellphone photos with
            backwards text. Very quick and simple implementation, could use some CSS but
            it's designed as a tool rather than an ad-revenue source, works without internet+</p>
